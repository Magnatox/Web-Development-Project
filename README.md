# Web Development Project

Project for School

ILYES SAIDI 201502203

HTML: Different style with the nav bar on the left side.

CSS: Modern feel with a simple yet strong color palette and smooth animations.

JS: Check if the mailing form is filled before sending the content and provide a reset button.

PHP: Simple contact me form script and additional pages for success or failure of the process.

Notes:

- Make sure your live server supports mailing; otherwise, the script won't work. If you are running on localhost, make sure to connect your Gmail account to SMTP by editing the php.ini file. This method should work, but the emails might be considered as spam.

- This project was miraculously completed in only 2 days.

- The project was submitted on June 9th, before the deadline.
